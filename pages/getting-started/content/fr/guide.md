# Hi there 

We're going to teach you `glamorous` by having you edit the guide you're reading 

# Titles

Let's start by making the headings on this page look nice. With `glamorous`, instead of the normal CSS syntax you maybe familiar with, we regular JavaScript objects.

Change the `Heading` to this:

```js
const Heading = glamorous.h1({
  fontSize: '2.4em',
  marginTop: 10,
  color: '#CC3A4B',
})
```

# Help!

That's all we have for now, but if you'd like to help with this guide that'd be super! Please check out [the GitHub repo!](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website)
