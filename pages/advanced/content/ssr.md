title: Server Side Rendering
---

Because both `glamor` and `react` support SSR, glamorous does too! I actually do this
on [my personal site](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com) which is generated at build-time
on the server. Learn about rendering
[`react` on the server](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html) and
[`glamor` too](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/5e7d988211330b8e2fca5bb8da78e35051444efd/docs/server.md).
