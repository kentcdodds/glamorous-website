[CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) is a relatively new layout tool for the web. It's incredibly powerful and expressive and enables new layouts that were previously very difficult or altogether impossible.

In this example, we use the [`@supports`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) feature of CSS to opt-into CSS Grid in browsers where this is available. Be warned that not all browsers will support `@supports`.
