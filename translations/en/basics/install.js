  This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org) and should be installed as one of your project's ~dependencies~:

  ~~~js
  npm install --save glamorous
  ~~~

  This also depends on ~react~ and ~glamor~ so you'll need those in your project as well (if you don't already have them):

  ~~~js
  npm install --save react glamor
  ~~~

  > NOTE: If you're using React v15.5 or greater, you'll also need to have
  > ~prop-types~ installed: ~npm install --save prop-types~
