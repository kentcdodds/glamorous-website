  Thanks for your interest in helping to update the website translations! The
  link below will take you to GitHub showing all the changes that happened
  between the last time **{FILE}** was updated to when the **{FALLBACK_FILE}**
  was most recently updated. Unfortunately this includes _all_ file changes,
  not just changes in **{FILE}**. So you'll have to click the "Files changed" tab,
  then search for **{FILE}** in the changes. Then you can open the editor link to
  update the translation. Thanks again!!
whatChangedLink: "See what's changed"
editorLink: 'Open GitHub Editor for {FILE}'
sorry: Looks like something's broken with that link... Please [file an issue](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website/issues/new)!
